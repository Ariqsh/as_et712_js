//Perhaps the best way to think of it is in having a variable called groceries, whose members might be milk, eggs, bacon, bread, juice, and fruit. An array might be thought of as a set, or a group

        groceries = ["Milk", "Eggs", "Bacon", "Juice", "Bread"]; //always start ith 0. here milk is 0 and bread is 4

        //console.log (groceries[0]); //displays displays in chrome in the inspect element

        groceries.push ("Bananas", "Coffee"); //

        //document.write (groceries[5]);
        
        //now for a conetent loop to display all the products on our array.
